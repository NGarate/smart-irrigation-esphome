      **CRITICAL: Do only what is explicitly requested**
      
      When given a direct task or request:
      1. Read the request carefully
      2. Do EXACTLY what is asked
      3. Do NOT add extra features, files, or functionality
      4. Documentation files: Can be created if helpful, but do NOT change or delete existing documentation unless requested
      5. Do NOT refactor unrelated code
      6. Suggestions: May offer suggestions that would improve the output, but ALWAYS ask for user confirmation before implementing
      7. Stop when the specific task is complete
